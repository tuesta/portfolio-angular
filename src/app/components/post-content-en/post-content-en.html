<h2 id="the-foundational-discontent">The foundational discontent</h2>
<p>My body knew it before my mind: I never wanted to be part of this collective fiction.<br>
A fiction that, by naturalizing the lack of rigor, masking poor designs, and institutionalizing error, turns mediocrity into the only horizon: a destiny accepted with the tranquility of the inevitable.</p>
<p>I loathe the <em>status quo</em> of programming.</p>
<p>I loathe ambiguity elevated to a virtue.</p>
<p>I loathe surrender disguised as pragmatism.</p>
<p>I loathe, above all, what sustains the fiction: that "freedom" which eliminates the idea of limits.</p>
<p>This idea of freedom condemns us to represent reality in its purest state: complex, unpredictable, chaotic. And I refuse. I refuse to trace reality.</p>
<p>Reality is deeply anti-aesthetic; it overwhelms me, it coarsens me. It reduces us to the literality of things, forcing us to operate at their level. It degrades reasoning to mere state processing, nullifying our capacity for abstraction.</p>
<p>Faced with this degradation, it is necessary to rebel: to reinterpret reality, strip it of its complexity, and subject it to the empire of reason.</p>
<h2 id="the-logic-of-limits">The logic of limits</h2>
<p>The ultimate purpose of a program is not to produce a correct output; it is to be capable of being reasoned about. Its correct operation is an inevitable consequence of that clarity. Without it, what we call "success" is only the silence before the error.</p>
<p>All reasoning needs axioms: fundamental truths that we accept as unquestionable starting points. We start from premises to build conclusions, advancing gradually toward the solution. This need is not accidental, but inherent to our cognitive nature.</p>
<p>Let us acknowledge our fundamental limitation: we are incapable of solving complex problems. Our strength lies in composition.</p>
<p>If we deny all restriction, we fall into the tyranny of freedom.<br>
A system that refuses to exclude becomes incapable of defining. Without definition, there can be no certainty; without exclusion, congruence cannot exist; without restriction, reasoning becomes impossible.<br>
The result is an inert universe—and necessarily inert: homogeneous, structurally gaseous, where everything floats in the void of the subjective.</p>
<h2 id="the-necessary-form">The necessary form</h2>
<p>The freedom that the status quo presents as indispensable was an illusion that execution could not sustain: a program that refuses to define its limits cannot help but collapse—its own logic demands coherence—and it is in this collapse that its true nature is revealed; without limits, coherence is impossible.</p>
<p>This conclusion leads us inevitably to define a constructive framework with logical solidity; we must humbly accept the limits of reasoning—limits that functional programming expresses with mathematical rigor—establishing the foundation from which coherent creation can emerge.</p>
<p>A new perspective: form is born from substance; the contour is born from restrictions.</p>
<p>Its essence is to define, with mathematical precision, the space where the solution can exist: to understand the problem in its purest state is to trace its limits.<br>
We do not invent, we discover—a natural consequence of this perspective. We transcend the established to forge our own restrictions, guided by the logic of the domain, until the solution reveals its necessary form.</p>
<p>The process of discovery must be protected from implementation, that necessary evil that commits us to imperfect reality. Its danger lies not in its existence, but in its premature appearance, which imposes an unaffordable cost: it limits abstraction in its composability, strips it of elegance, and reduces it to the specific.</p>
<p>We define a universe of clear rules where the solution reveals itself without being sought. Unexpected structural riches then emerge, relations we did not see, paths that lead us to a more general, simpler, truer solution.</p>
<p>We feel the deep inevitability of design as we flow through the stream of restrictions. Each step consolidates certainties; we can declare the impossible, affirm the necessary. What is correct becomes evident; what is false, unrepresentable.</p>
<p>Execution—merely useful, deeply anti-aesthetic—is the side effect of an abstraction that does not need reality.</p>
